<h2>About:</h2>
<p>I'm a Bioinformatics major in my senior year at Brigham Young University. 
    My minors are Computer Science and Mandarin Chinese. I spent 18 months in Taiwan learning the language.
    I hope to find an introductory coding job (or at least an internship) after I graduate in December 2021.
</p>

<h2>Projects:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Format Conversion: a tool based in Python that facilitates conversion between common dataset formats.</li>
    <li>Polygenic Risk Score Knowledge Base: a website that uses GWA findings to calculate polygenic risk scores, which aggregate the genetic risk across all associated loci. 
        <a href="https://prs.byu.edu">prs.byu.edu</a>
    </li>
    <li>Climate Browser: a Shiny app designed to help ecology students develop data literacy.
